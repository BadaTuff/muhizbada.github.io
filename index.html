        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a transformative experience that has shaped both my technical abilities and my professional identity. When I began this program, I had a foundational interest in technology but lacked the structured knowledge and practical skills needed to work as a software developer. Over the course of the program, I have developed proficiency across multiple domains of computer science, from mobile application development to full-stack web engineering to database design. My professional goal is to work as a software engineer building applications that solve real problems for real users, and this program has given me the technical foundation and the professional mindset to pursue that goal.</p>
        <p>This capstone course has been particularly valuable because it required me to revisit previous work with a critical eye, identify weaknesses I did not recognize at the time, and apply the knowledge I have gained throughout the program to make meaningful improvements. The three artifacts in this ePortfolio represent that growth: they show not just what I can build, but how I think about building software well.</p>

        <h3>Collaborating in Team Environments</h3>
        <p>Throughout the Computer Science program, I developed skills essential for collaborating effectively in team-based software development environments. I gained experience using Git for version control, which is fundamental to how modern development teams coordinate their work. Understanding branching strategies, pull requests, and merge conflict resolution prepared me for the collaborative workflows used in professional settings.</p>
        <p>The code review process during this capstone course reinforced the importance of collaborative quality assurance. By recording a detailed code review of my artifacts, I practiced the discipline of examining code critically, explaining design decisions clearly, and identifying areas for improvement. Writing modular, well-documented code is not just a personal best practice; it is an obligation to teammates who will need to understand, maintain, and extend that code in the future.</p>

        <h3>Communicating to Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>Effective communication with stakeholders is a critical skill that I have developed throughout this program. The narrative documents I wrote for each milestone required me to explain technical decisions in terms that connect to business value and project goals. Rather than simply describing what I changed, I had to articulate why each enhancement matters, what trade-offs were involved, and how the improvements align with professional standards.</p>
        <p>The code review video required me to present technical analysis verbally, walking through code while explaining its strengths, weaknesses, and planned improvements. This experience mirrors the kinds of presentations that software engineers regularly give to project managers, clients, and cross-functional teams.</p>

        <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
        <p>The algorithms and data structures enhancement to the WeightAppUI application demonstrates my understanding of how the right data structure choices directly impact application performance. I implemented a dual data structure approach, combining an ArrayList for O(1) positional access with a HashMap for O(1) average-case lookup by ID. I also implemented sorting using the Comparator pattern, predicate-based filtering, and statistical analysis algorithms with documented Big-O complexity for each operation.</p>

        <h3>Software Engineering and Databases</h3>
        <p>For software engineering, the WeightAppUI enhancement focused on improving code quality, architecture, and maintainability through comprehensive input validation, improved error handling, and thorough documentation. For databases, the Travlr Getaways enhancement showcased advanced MongoDB capabilities including skip/limit pagination, strategic indexing, aggregation pipelines for analytics, and full-text search. These enhancements demonstrate proficiency with the MEAN stack architecture and professional database design.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Security is a thread that runs through all three of my artifact enhancements. The most significant improvement was implementing bcrypt password hashing in the WeightAppUI application to replace plain text password storage. I also implemented comprehensive input validation, whitelist-based sort field protection in the Travlr API, pagination limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks, and JWT authentication for all write operations. These practices reflect an understanding that security must be integrated throughout design and implementation, not added as an afterthought.</p>

        <h3>Artifacts Summary</h3>
        <p>This ePortfolio contains three artifact enhancements that together demonstrate the breadth and depth of skills I have developed:</p>
        <p><strong><a href="enhancement1.html">Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</a></strong> - The WeightAppUI Android application, enhanced with bcrypt password hashing, comprehensive input validation, improved error handling, and thorough code documentation.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="enhancement2.html">Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</a></strong> - The WeightAppUI application, enhanced with HashMap-based lookups, Comparator-pattern sorting, predicate-based filtering, and statistical analysis algorithms.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="enhancement3.html">Enhancement Three: Databases</a></strong> - The Travlr Getaways full-stack web application, enhanced with pagination, strategic indexing, MongoDB aggregation pipelines, full-text search, and advanced filtering.</p>
